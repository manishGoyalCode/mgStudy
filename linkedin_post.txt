ðŸš€ Excited to Share Something Personal

You know that feeling when you have dozens of browser tabs open with articles you want to read "later"? That was me, constantly losing track of valuable content I wanted to learn from.

So I built something. Not just another reading list app, but something different. Something that respects your privacy and puts you in control.

Introducing Reading Tracker - born from a personal need, crafted for everyone who values their digital reading journey.

What makes it special?
â€¢ Your data stays with you, on your device. Always.
â€¢ No cloud sync, no accounts, no tracking - just you and your reading list
â€¢ Works offline, because learning shouldn't depend on internet connectivity
â€¢ As simple as jotting down notes in your favorite notebook

I built this for myself, and it transformed how I consume online content. No more lost articles, no more "I'll read it later" and forget about it.

Today, I'm sharing it with you. Because sometimes, the best solutions come from solving our own problems.

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. How do you keep track of your reading list?
